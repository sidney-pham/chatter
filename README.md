# chatter
This really is the most awesome thing ever!
chatter is a messaging web-app where you can add friends and send them private messages!
It is insecure at the moment, so don't actually use it, but there's good code at least, yay!

--------
To install,

1. [Install Meteor](https://www.meteor.com/install).  
Or, if you have OSX/Linux, just do:

```
curl https://install.meteor.com/ | sh
```

2. Clone this repo!

```
git clone https://github.com/sidney-pham/chatter
```

3. `cd` (probably) into the folder
4. run `meteor`. That should work!
