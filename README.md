# chatter
Truly something awesome.
**chatter** is a messaging web-app where you can add friends and send them private messages!

## Warning
---
It is insecure at the moment, so don't actually use it for messaging, but there's good code at least, yay! Will be fixed soon!

## Installation
- [Install Meteor](https://www.meteor.com/install).
Or, if you have OSX/Linux, just do:

```
curl https://install.meteor.com/ | sh
```

- Clone this repo!

```
git clone https://github.com/sidney-pham/chatter
```

- `cd` (probably) into the folder.
- Run `meteor`. That should work!
